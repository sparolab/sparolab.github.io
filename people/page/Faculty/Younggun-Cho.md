        Before joining Inha University, I was an assistant professor in the Department of Robotics Engineering at Yeungnam. Also, I was a postdoctoral researcher at KAIST. My research interest is long-term autonomy and robust sensing, including SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for field robots, vision-based perception, and physical-based learning.

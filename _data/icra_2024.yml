- title: Salience-guided Ground Factor for Robust Localization of  Delivery Robots in Complex Urban Environments
  abstract: >
    In urban environments for delivery robots, particularly in areas such as campuses and towns, many custom features defy standard road semantic categorizations. 
    Addressing this challenge, our paper introduces a method leveraging Salient Object Detection (SOD) to extract these unique features, employing them as pivotal factors for enhanced robot loop closure and localization. 
    Traditional geometric feature-based localization is hampered by fluctuating illumination and appearance changes. 
    Our preference for SOD over semantic segmentation sidesteps the intricacies of classifying a myriad of non-standardized urban features. 
    To achieve consistent ground features, the Motion Compensate IPM (MC-IPM) technique is implemented, capitalizing on a motion for distortion compensation and subsequently selecting the most pertinent salient ground features through moment computations. 
    For thorough evaluation, we validated saliency detection and localization performances in real urban scenarios.

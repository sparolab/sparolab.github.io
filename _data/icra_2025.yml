- title: Robust Visual SLAM with Auxiliary Range Factor for Degenerate Construction Environments
  abstract: >
    Robust localization in degenerate environments such as construction sites remains challenging due to frequent visual degradation and intermittent range sensing. 
    To address this challenge, we propose a visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) framework that tightly integrates visual-inertial odometry (VIO), visual loop closure, and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) range measurements through a factor graph optimization. 
    The proposed system introduces an interpolated range factor, fully utilizing sparse and asynchronous UWB data by leveraging continuous-time pose interpolation. 
    We evaluate the method on the public dataset under simulated degenerate scenarios, including visual degradation and partial UWB signal loss. 
    Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces drift and maintains accurate global localization, even under severe sensor degradation.
